# Cluster Analysis for Advertising Insights

## Introduction

Explore the intricacies of user engagement and behavior with my comprehensive Cluster Analysis for Advertising Insights project. This analysis delves deep into an e-commerce advertising dataset, leveraging Python's robust libraries to segment user profiles and unveil critical interaction trends.

## Key Findings

- **Ad Placement & Timing**: Users may click on ads soon after site arrival, suggesting ad placements may be optimized for immediate engagement.
- **User Intent**: Specific user needs influence ad clicks, with intent-driven users engaging with ads more quickly than casual browsers.
- **Ad Relevance & Targeting**: Highly targeted ads lead to early clicks, indicating precise ad algorithms successfully reaching intended demographics.
- **Engagement vs. Conversion**: High site engagement doesn't necessarily correlate with ad clicks, which can be more related to ad relevance.
- **Economic Factors**: Different income levels show varied interactions with ads, with lower-income users more likely to click on ads offering deals.

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for clustering
