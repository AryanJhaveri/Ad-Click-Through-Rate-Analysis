# Cluster Analysis for Advertising Insights

## Introduction

Delve into user behavior and demographic analytics with our in-depth Cluster Analysis for Advertising Insights project. Utilizing a rich advertising dataset, this project seeks to unravel the myriad factors that steer users towards engaging with online advertisements. By dissecting aspects such as site engagement time, age, income levels, internet usage, and temporal engagement patterns, we provide a multifaceted view of digital ad interactions.

## Key Findings

- **User Engagement**: Users engaging with ads exhibited shorter site visit durations and lower average income, pointing to ad targeting that appeals to users making prompt, cost-effective decisions.
- **Demographics**: Analyzing age and income within ad-clicking clusters revealed distinct segments, suggesting that ads can be more effectively tailored to demographic-specific patterns.
- **Internet Usage**: Users with high internet usage did not necessarily interact more with ads, indicating room for optimization in ad content and placement.
- **Temporal Patterns**: Investigating ad click timestamps uncovered optimal periods for launching ad campaigns, aligning with user activity spikes for increased impact.

## Cluster Insights

- **Cluster 0**: High internet users with low ad interaction, hinting at a need for more captivating ad content.
- **Cluster 1**: Moderate internet users with the highest interaction, representing a prime target for ad campaigns.
- **Cluster 2**: Behaviorally similar to Cluster 1 but with lower income levels, emphasizing the influence of economic considerations.

## Implications and Recommendations

- **Tailored Content**: Craft ads that resonate with the preferences and habits of each user cluster.
- **Strategic Timing**: Align ad campaigns with peak times identified through timestamp analysis to maximize reach.
- **Economic Targeting**: Factor in the economic backgrounds of clusters to inform product selection and ad messaging.
